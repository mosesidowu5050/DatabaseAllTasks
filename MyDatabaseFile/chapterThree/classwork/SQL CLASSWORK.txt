SQL CLASSWORK
 3.1	a. Existing data
	b. from the development of new information systems
	c. from the redesign of existing databases.

3.2	The basic premise of this chapter is to received one or more 
	tables of data from some source that are to be stored in a new database.

3.3	This table has a problem called a multivalued dependency.

3.4a. 	Relation store data about an entity, the names of the columns are unique; no two 
	columns in the same relation may have the same name.

   b.	Functional dependency is when the value of one or more attributes 
	determines the value of another attribute. 

   c. 	A determinant is unique in a relation if and only if it determines 
	every other column in the relation.

   d. 	A composite key is a key that consists of two or more columns.
   e. 	A candidate key is a key with no repeated values, determines all of the other columns in a relation. 
   f. 	A primary key is a candidate key selected as the primary key.
   g. 	A surrogate key is an artificial column added to a relation to serve as a primary key.
   h. 	A foreign key is a column or composite of columns that is the primary key of a table other 
	than the one in which it appears. 
   i. 	Referential integrity constraint, which is a statement that limits the values of the foreign key. 
   j. 	Relations are categorized into normal forms based on the kinds of problems that they have. 
   k. 	A multivalued dependency occurs when a determinant is matched with a particular set of values.

3.5	Domain integrity constraint, all of the values in a column are of the same kind.
